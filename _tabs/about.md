Technical Experience
--------------------

My Cool Side Project
:   Her are some projects I have worked on in my spare time, and other resources.

    * [Nim_Game_Java](https://github.com/RHG101997/Nim_Game_Java) for better review here is a video about it (here)[https://youtu.be/EwzbEp6SbEM]
    * cLog: Command line coloring using python. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gx3Dt7MoK0&ab_channel=RichardHernandez)
    * Tile based Terrain using P5.js for rendering. The porject is aviable in this website, or here is a [video](https://youtu.be/l4nAdEntGf8) about the not updated version. [Code Here](https://editor.p5js.org/RHG101997/sketches/6IdZG40H0)


Programming Languages
:   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**
