    * SynthesisOfSinusoidalSignals: It is a project for creating sound in matlab using frequencies. I did a small paper about found in [Here](https://github.com/RHG101997/SynthesisOfSinusoidalSignals).


Programming Languages
:   **C++:** First language I learned to use in high school, it was called to my attention due to the desire of creating games. Later on I found it to be almost every where in computer science and in engineering.

:   **Python:** Most of my classes at university some how reference this language and it is really good for creating prototypes and make fast servers or networking. I created a list with most of my scripts used from gaming to file manipulation found here in [py_scripts].

:   **Java:** This language was used my some of my algorithm classes in University, and most of the advance concepts in OOP I learned using Java.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **golang**, others.
